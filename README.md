# Typora-Portable

The portable version of [typora](https://typora.io/#windows), go to [Release](https://github.com/tobyqin/Typora-Portable/releases) page to download the portable zip package.

Please note, this is only for Windows platform.

# Why need to be portable?

Typora is my favourite markdown editor, but everytime using a new PC I have to reinstall it time to time. What's more, installing Typora needs administrator priviledge, I might not have that on new PC.

# How do I create the portable package?

It is pretty simple to make a portable typora:

1. Prepare a clean VM
2. Install Typora 32 bit to C:\Typora
4. Delete some files that definitly not required, e.g. uninstall.*
3. Zip the installation folder
4. Publish the package to release page.

At least it works well for now.

# Any other plan?

No, this repo might be not maintained lately, depends on my time. Current released version works great.
